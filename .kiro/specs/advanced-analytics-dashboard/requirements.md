# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive analytics dashboard that goes beyond Google Analytics by providing advanced user behavior insights, cohort analysis, and heatmap visualizations. The system will fix the current heatmap data collection issues and build powerful analytics tools to understand user engagement patterns, content performance, and reader journey progression.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Cohort Analysis System

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to analyze user behavior cohorts so that I can understand how different user segments engage with my content over time and optimize my content strategy accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user cohorts THEN the system SHALL segment users by first visit date, content type preference, and engagement level
2. WHEN a user visits multiple posts THEN the system SHALL track their progression from casual reader to engaged reader to regular visitor
3. WHEN displaying cohort data THEN the system SHALL show retention rates, engagement progression, and content preference evolution over time
4. WHEN comparing cohorts THEN the system SHALL identify which content types convert casual visitors into regular readers
5. WHEN analyzing user journey THEN the system SHALL track reading depth progression, time spent evolution, and content type preferences across visits

### Requirement 2: Heatmap Data Collection Fix

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want accurate heatmap data collection so that I can visualize where users click and interact with content to optimize page layouts and content placement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on content THEN the system SHALL correctly save normalized coordinates (x, y) to the BlogAnalytics table with clickX and clickY fields
2. WHEN storing click data THEN the system SHALL include viewport dimensions, scroll position, element type, and text content
3. WHEN processing analytics events THEN the system SHALL use the correct database table (BlogAnalytics) instead of the incorrect analyticsEvent table
4. WHEN saving heatmap data THEN the system SHALL map metadata fields properly to database columns (x→clickX, y→clickY)
5. WHEN collecting interaction data THEN the system SHALL capture scroll depth, reading time, and element interactions with proper normalization

### Requirement 3: Interactive Heatmap Visualization

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to visualize user interaction heatmaps so that I can see where users click, scroll, and engage most with my content to optimize layout and content placement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a post's analytics THEN the system SHALL display a heatmap overlay showing click density and interaction patterns
2. WHEN generating heatmaps THEN the system SHALL use kernel density estimation to create smooth heat zones from discrete click points
3. WHEN displaying heatmaps THEN the system SHALL be responsive and scale properly across different viewport sizes
4. WHEN analyzing heatmap data THEN the system SHALL show click intensity, scroll depth patterns, and interaction hotspots
5. WHEN filtering heatmap data THEN the system SHALL allow date ranges, device types, and user segment filtering

### Requirement 4: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a content creator and data analyst, I want a comprehensive analytics dashboard so that I can access all advanced metrics, cohort analysis, and heatmap data in one centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display user cohort analysis, content performance metrics, and heatmap visualizations
2. WHEN viewing cohort data THEN the system SHALL show user progression charts, retention curves, and engagement evolution graphs
3. WHEN analyzing content performance THEN the system SHALL display reading completion rates, engagement scores, and optimal content length recommendations
4. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the system SHALL show trends, growth patterns, and performance changes over time
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow CSV/JSON export of analytics data for further analysis

### Requirement 5: Content Performance Scoring

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want an automated content performance scoring system so that I can quickly identify my best-performing content and understand what makes content successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL calculate a composite performance score based on reading time, scroll depth, return visits, and social sharing
2. WHEN scoring content THEN the system SHALL weight metrics based on content type (tutorial vs blog post vs announcement)
3. WHEN displaying scores THEN the system SHALL show performance trends, comparative rankings, and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight common characteristics of high-performing content
5. WHEN recommending optimizations THEN the system SHALL suggest content length, structure, and topic improvements based on performance data

### Requirement 6: Real-time Analytics Processing

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want real-time analytics processing so that I can see user behavior patterns and content performance updates without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL process analytics events in real-time without blocking user experience
2. WHEN aggregating data THEN the system SHALL update dashboard metrics within 5 minutes of user interactions
3. WHEN handling high traffic THEN the system SHALL queue analytics events efficiently to prevent data loss
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use background jobs for heavy computations like heatmap generation
5. WHEN displaying live data THEN the system SHALL show current active users, real-time engagement, and live interaction patterns

### Requirement 7: Privacy-Compliant Data Collection

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want privacy-compliant analytics so that I can collect valuable insights while respecting user privacy and complying with data protection regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting user data THEN the system SHALL anonymize IP addresses and avoid collecting personally identifiable information
2. WHEN storing analytics data THEN the system SHALL use session-based tracking without persistent user identification
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL provide data retention controls and automatic cleanup of old analytics data
4. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to remove user-specific analytics data
5. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL aggregate data to prevent individual user identification
