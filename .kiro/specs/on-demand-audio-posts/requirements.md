# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add text-to-speech audio generation for blog posts on an on-demand basis. Instead of pre-generating audio for all 182 posts, the system will generate audio only when a user requests it, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for audio content delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to listen to blog posts as audio, so that I can consume content while multitasking or when I prefer audio format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a blog post THEN the system SHALL display an audio player with a "Generate Audio" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Audio" THEN the system SHALL convert the post text to speech and display a playable audio player
3. WHEN audio generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with estimated time
4. WHEN audio generation is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically start playing the audio
5. WHEN a user returns to a post with previously generated audio THEN the system SHALL display the cached audio immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want audio to be generated only when requested, so that I can minimize costs and storage requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a post is published THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically generate audio
2. WHEN audio is requested for the first time THEN the system SHALL generate and cache the audio file
3. WHEN audio already exists for a post THEN the system SHALL serve the cached version
4. WHEN a post is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate the cached audio and regenerate on next request
5. IF audio generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to track audio usage analytics, so that I can understand which posts benefit most from audio format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates audio THEN the system SHALL log the audio generation event
2. WHEN a user plays audio THEN the system SHALL track play events and duration
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display audio generation and play statistics per post
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show total audio generation costs and usage trends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use OpenRouter's text-to-speech API, so that I can leverage cost-effective and high-quality voice synthesis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouter's TTS API
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and retries
3. WHEN selecting voice options THEN the system SHALL use a consistent, professional Spanish voice
4. IF OpenRouter is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to an alternative TTS service
5. WHEN estimating costs THEN the system SHALL calculate based on character count and OpenRouter pricing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want audio controls and playback features, so that I can have a good listening experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is available THEN the system SHALL provide play/pause, seek, and volume controls
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL show current time and total duration
3. WHEN user navigates away THEN the system SHALL remember playback position
4. WHEN returning to the post THEN the system SHALL resume from the last position
5. WHEN audio ends THEN the system SHALL provide options to replay or navigate to related posts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the audio player to be implemented as a reusable component with minimalist and elegant design, so that it can be easily integrated across different parts of the application while maintaining consistent UX.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the audio player THEN the system SHALL create a reusable React component
2. WHEN designing the component THEN the system SHALL follow minimalist design principles with clean, elegant styling
3. WHEN integrating the component THEN the system SHALL accept props for customization (post content, styling options)
4. WHEN displaying the component THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy with the existing design system
5. WHEN used across different contexts THEN the component SHALL adapt responsively to different container sizes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator and business owner, I want to capture detailed blog engagement metrics beyond basic analytics, so that I can understand user behavior patterns, content performance, and optimize my content strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a blog post THEN the system SHALL track reading time, scroll depth, and engagement patterns
2. WHEN a user interacts with content THEN the system SHALL capture click heatmaps, text selection, and copy events
3. WHEN analyzing content performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on reading completion rates, bounce points, and popular sections
4. WHEN users engage with audio THEN the system SHALL track audio vs text preference patterns and completion rates
5. WHEN viewing analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display content performance trends, user journey flows, and engagement insights
6. WHEN tracking user sessions THEN the system SHALL respect privacy by using anonymous session IDs and avoiding PII collection
